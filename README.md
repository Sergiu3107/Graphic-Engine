# OpenGL-Scene

Imagine a dynamic 3D scene created using OpenGL, enhanced with the GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) and GLFW (Graphics Library Framework) libraries. This scene offers a captivating view of the Moon's surface, populated by a variety of characters including astronauts, aliens, and even the iconic character Shrek. Adding to the scene's complexity are moving objects like asteroids and the Earth itself, alongside futuristic spacecraft.

Users can navigate through the scene using both mouse and keyboard controls, allowing for a fully immersive experience. Moreover, the scene's ambiance can be adjusted through interactive features such as manipulating fog density, altering the direction of light sources, and toggling the illumination on and off. These elements contribute to creating a visually stunning and interactive environment for users to explore and enjoy.
